# Bathroom Reads!

### What is it?
Bathroom Reads is a bite-sized information-slash-content mobile application designed for when you only have a few minutes to take in anything new.
Users are able to personalize their feed to fit their tastes by including and excluding categories which are specific to each individual user. 
From there, users are able to view posts that match the specified categories in a one-by-one fashion. They're able to browse posts and toggle a like.

### What is it made of?
This application uses a React Native frontend and a Ruby on Rails API backend. 
React Native is a Javascript-based library specially geared towards universal mobile platform compatibility.
Additionally, the backend uses a PostgreSQL relational database for storing all of the posts, likes, and categories that users have subscribed to.
